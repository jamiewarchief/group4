<h2>All about me</h2>
<p>This is the part where I do something that I absolutely hate - talking about myself!j My name is Emma and I am 32
    years old. I have been married to my best friend Adam for 5 years this year. We have a cat called Philip and a dog
    called Ripley. We are currently living with my dad so we can save for a house -it's a bit of a pain in the ass at
    times, but I'm grateful that we're here or my dad would have been all alone during the lockdowns, well he would have
    had his dog Benji, who lives with us as well. </p>

<h2>Is she dead, yes or no??</h2>
<p>This heading was taken from the Samuel L Jackson Slipsum page and it automatically generated me a paragraph from
    something that Samuel Jackson said in the movie 'Glass' - I think on reflection after deleting the original
    paragraph that was in here, that it could probbaly have stayed as it was more PG than the first paragraph that I had
    in here. </p>
